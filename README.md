# Mead Family - Learn my ABCs

See Live site [HERE](https://mmeadx.github.io/meadABCs/)


Using a combination of javaScript, DOM manipulation and CSS, this is an interactive web app allowing the user to click on a letter of the alphabet to see an image and hear a word associated with that letter. 

The first version was about 200 lines of JavaScript and ~200 lines of CSS created at the beginning of 2021. Since the creation of the app and learning more JS - I was able to get the JavaScript down to ~40 lines of code and ~60 lines for the CSS.


_Application code adapted from the [Udemy course "The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp" "Drum Kit" Lesson](https://www.udemy.com/share/101qYwAEEYeVpVTXgB/)._

_New application updated after taking the [50 Projects in 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript course](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/)._
