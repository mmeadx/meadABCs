# Mead Family - Learn my ABCs

See Live site [HERE](https://mmeadx.github.io/meadABCs/)


Using a combination of javaScript, DOM manipulation and CSS, this is an interactive web app allowing the user to click on a letter of the alphabet to see an image and hear a word associated with that letter.

**_APPLICATION SCREENSHOT_**

_The intent of this was to create an application that my nephews could use to learn their alphabets. By clicking on each letter they would see something that they could associate with in their life that begins with that letter (ie: "M" is for "Mom")_
